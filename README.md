- The sinking of the RMS Titanic in the early morning of __15 April 1912, four days into the ship's maiden voyage__ from __Southampton to New York City__, was one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history, __killing__ more 
than **1,500 people**. 

- The largest passenger liner in service at the time, Titanic had an __estimated 2,224 people on board__ when she struck an __iceberg in the North Atlantic__. 

- The ship had received __six warnings__ of sea ice but was travelling at near __maximum speed when the lookouts sighted the iceberg__. 

<br> 

- __Unable to turn quickly enough__, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled the starboard (right) side and opened __five of sixteen compartments to the sea__. 

- The disaster caused widespread outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax regulations, and the __unequal treatment__ of the three passenger classes __during the evacuation__. 

- Inquiries recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations, leading to the __International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (1914)__, which continues to govern maritime safety.

### 2. Problem Statement

- On __April 15, 1912__, the largest passenger liner ever made collided with an __iceberg__ during her maiden voyage. 

- When the __Titanic sank it killed 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew__.

- This __sensational__ tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for **ships**. 

- One of the reasons that the **shipwreck** resulted in such loss of life was that there were **not enough lifeboats** for the passengers and crew. 

- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others such as **women, children, and the upper-class.**

## 7. Conclusion 

- With the help of this notebook we learnt how exploratory data analysis can be carried out using Pandas plotting.
- Also we have seen making use of packages like __matplotlib and seaborn__ to develop better insights about the data.<br/>
- We have also seen how __pre-proceesing__ helps in dealing with _missing_ values and irregualities present in the data. We also learnt how to _create new features_ which will in turn help us to better predict the survival. 
- We also make use of __pandas profiling__ feature to generate an html report containing all the information of the various features present in the dataset.
- We have seen the impact of columns like _Age, Embarked, Fare, SibSp and Parch_ on the rate of survival.
- The most important inference drawn from all this analysis is, we get to know what are the __features on which survival is highly positively and negatively correlated with.__ 
- This analysis will help us to choose which __machine learning model__ we can apply to predict survival of test dataset. 

- The **`titanic.csv`** file contains data for **891** of the real Titanic passengers. 
  - Each row represents one person. 

  - The columns describe different attributes about the person including whether they survived, their age, their ticket-class, their sex and the fare they paid.

<br> 

- The goal of this analysis is to analyse the data set, explore it answering related questions using data visualization and statistical methods. 

- There are also some questions we would like to answer with Titanic dataset analysis.

  - What is passengers demographic structure analyzed in terms of attributes?

  - What is the overall passengers survival ratio?

  - Which groups have higher chances for survival?
